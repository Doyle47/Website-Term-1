# Website-Term-1
My code is a website about weird things that you can find on the internet.
This website starts of on a home page that then brings you to multiple other pages where there is one weird fact, image or idea per page.

I would like to have a big dtatabase of pages and a way to make it so that when you select one of the choices underneath the page a graph pops up showing you what others have answered.

So far I have a home page and 6 different pages that you can access. You access each page by going through a randomizer that brings you to a random page. There are the choices underneath the pages and there is also a login page.

I would like to be able to make the graph pop up after each choice is selected, I would like to have more pages with weird facts and maybe even a way to let other people submit pags that have their own weird facts on it. I would also like there to be a way to log in so that their previous answers are saved, that they do not need to redo the same pages and so that they can see statistics about what they have answered compared to other people using this website.
